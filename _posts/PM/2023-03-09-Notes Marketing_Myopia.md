---

*  Growth of company slowed , even though market has no satuaration -> Failure of Managment
*  What is bussiness and what is product of bussiness
   + E.g.  Railways is in bussiness of transportation with rail as product

* concept refers to shortsightedness of businesses that focus on their products rather than the needs of their customers.
* failure of management to recognize the broader needs of the market and to adapt to changing customer demands
* lead to a decline in growth and profitability as companies fail to innovate and meet the changing needs of their customers.

* Myths which lead to  risk of obsolescence
	+ Ever expanding population will ensure growth ( Increase efficiency of product, rather than value delivered by product)
	+ No Competitive substitute for our industry's major product ( No rival )
	+ Mass production at less unit price is key
	+ Techical Research and Dev leads to growth ( Breakthourgh in products rather than consumer needs)
	
* growth industry - No such thing!
  + only companies organized and operated to create and capitalize on growth opportunities	
  
  
### Takeaways
* Build product around consumer, invent technology over consumer requirement. Otherway round is foul way.
* Product is appreciated if it fullfills consumer needs
* Reducing Unit costs of product until consumer needs are fullfilled is risky
