### Understanding Influence
* Energize in macro timescale, painful in micro timescale, Tune it!
* Drivers for Influence
    + 1. Storytelling 
    + 2. Alignment
    + 3. Trust
    + 4. Authority
    + 5. Rigor
    + 6. Charisma

* Nuances
    + Authority, alignment - Depends on position in Org Structure, less in control, Mode of persuasion authority, ethos  (Strucutral Driver)
    + Charisma,Storytelling - Depends on pathos , Mode of persuasion with emotion (Inspirational Driver)

    + Easy Mode =  High authority + high alignment

### Executive Level Influencing
* Frame problem into 2
    + Challenges to Fix
        - Limited Product Context  -> use Rigor
        - Limited Time  -> use Trust

    + Opportunites accessible
        -  Company Level Context ->  Use Alignment
        -  Decision-Making   -> use Authority

* Trust Equation = Intent x Track Record x Accountability

### Principles for Influencing Executives
* Over-prepare
* Align proposal to stated priorities of executives
* Trust by Proxy
* Communicate at their context level
* View message with their lens, Simulate Meeting
    + Product leader Archetype
        - Operator
            * Metrics and industry data

### Influence Dependency Teams

* 2. Getting right people Excited on project
    + Normally tech leads, staff engineers
* 3. Make it their idea
    + See if they brainstorm with you or workout on proposal
* 4. Put their name on proposal for co-creation
    + Over communicate  with your manager so they are aware 
* 5. Send them team update
    + Let them see progress,delivery and impact on user/bussiness
* 6. Be persistent

### Escalation as Unblocking process
* Resolving new dependencies that were apparent in planning
* Ask Exec Team for unblock
* Mutual unblocking specificaiton
    + Layout problem, conflicts and solutions
* Including reports for execs, for decision over unblock
* Decision Log, and commit for parties

## Bonus
* Influence by starting with principle
* Influence by presenting framework
* Nost problems are messaging problems
    + ah, tell me more
    + It seems to me that we agree more than we disagree
    + On scale 1-10, how strongly you feel about this?
    +  Do you want to  be primary on this decision or would you rather I be primary
    + I have x% confidence in my opinion. Whats you % confidence?
    +  You are right

* Remote Influence
    + In Person body lang is best source of trust. Vulneribility
