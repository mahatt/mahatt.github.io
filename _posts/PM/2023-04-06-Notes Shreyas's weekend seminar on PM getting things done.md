* think first principles, and be creative!
* Unblocking https://twitter.com/nurijanian/status/1642950649204670465

Habits
1. Summaries meeting into decisions made,actions required, owners assigned
   Challenge : Takes more than action, intent
   Hack:  Feed Rewards to your Primary Motivator
   Challenge: Resistance/fear to habit 1 
   Hack: CHoosing words correctly, always recap action/owners/decisions whether lead/participate, Practise more
   
2. Prep for meetings in daily early routine

*  Questions: 
   What is outcome?
   What are challenges?
   How will it be concuqred?
   
* First, understand the collaborative situation you’re in.
Meta-framework: 4 types of cross-team collaboration dynamics    
- Inter-team conflict arises when:
    - There is low alignment between goals & incentives between teams, or
    - There is interpersonal conflict between leaders or key players between teams (compatibility of personal values and working styles)
- Low-low: frustrated
    - The worst-case scenario
- High-high: integrated
    - The best-case scenario
- High-low: pragmatic
    - Most important and trickiest
    - Conflict arises due to how work gets done and who gets credit
    - Focus on clarity of expectations and emphasize evidence-based decisions
    - Always communicate progress jointly
- Low-high: empathetic
    - Show early progress to management to create greater goals alignment, to influence them to support on better aligning goals moving forward
    - Avoid giving in for relationship reasons when it might compromise broader company outcome
  

3.Create Routine Of day divided in slot
* Morning Routine
  + Calendar > to-do list 
  + Limit meetings and cluster meeting times
  + At the end of the work day, plan next day 
  + Fit the next day’s tasks in calendar
  + Plan next week on Friday PM 
* DeepWork Block
* Continuous Meeting
* Break+Email/Slack/Ops
* High Leverage meeting
* Emails/Slac/Ops
* Continuous Meeting
* WrapUp, Next Day planning Or Weekly Plannnig

5. Schedule initiated/influenced meetings around imposed meetings 
* 3 types of meetings:
  - Imposed on you
  - Influenced by you
  - Initiated by you

6.Break, Slack/Email Blocks
7.deep work blocks
- Make use of no-meeting days
- More hours of deep work
- Mute Slack notifications during your deep work blocks
- Change your working location for your deep work

8.High leverage meetings Shreyas absolutely swears by

- Weekly Sales sync
- 2:2s with EM and PM of each team
- Monthly Execution Review
- Business Growth Meeting
- Monthly career chat with direct reports
- Product deep-dives
- Pre-mortems for big launches
- New team member intro bubble tea party

9️.Plan for next day, before signing off for the day
- Block time off on your calendar!

10.Monthly planning my big 3 priorities
- Rule spend 60-80% of your time in the month on big items

11.Fight resistance with first drafts

12.Writing and sending interview notes
- 45-min interviews + 15-min debrief
- Google Doc template for interview notes
    - During the interview, fill in raw notes
    - Score each response as you’re going through the interview
    - Summary: call out pros and cons of the candidate
    - Overall verdict about the candidate

13.Debrief meetings after important Exec meetings
- Right after the important meeting
- Core team and stakeholders who participated in the meeting
- Structure to meeting
- Benefits:
    - Brings everyone on the same page
    - Improves morale

14. Running your own performance cycle
- Google Form survey or during 1-1
- Share with 3-5 colleagues whose feedback really matters to you
- Works particularly well with a colleague you find more challenging to work with

15.Building a great network,strategically 
- Ask trusted colleagues to name 5 people they know are really great in your company
- Reach out to them with a friendly message
- Not everyone will be able to respond, but usually 4/5 of them will
