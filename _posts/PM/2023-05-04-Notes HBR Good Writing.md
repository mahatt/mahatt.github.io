title: "[Notes] HBR Good Writing : It begins with principles" 
---

*   Have a clear purpose
    + To Explain action taken
      > "Given situation of regressions, we have determined to best course of action is to backout all changelist"
    + To influence to take action
      > "I hope that our new process guidelines will help reduce regressions analysis time and efforts."
    + To direct Actions
      > "Architect team has to complete and deliver process guidlines by end of week."  
    + To Convey information
      > "Architect want all engineers to know process guidelines are available at documentation server"
    + To Good/Bad News
      > "Unfortunetly, process guidelines were not part of deliverables"
      
* Be audience focused
    + Customer Focused analogies  
        - udnerstanding customer preferences and attitudes
        - how customer perceives values
        - how they want to be served
        - what gets their attention
    + Factors to consider
        -  Relationship with reader  authority action vs persuasion actions
        -  Information Process Styles  Engineering vs Marketing
        -  What they know already, no need to repeat
        -  Divergent interest
        
* State your key message clearly
  + Take away message
  + If message is not clear or compact check if includes two unrelated messages, Solution by writing two documents seperate
* Stay on Topic
    + Keep connection to key message
    
* Observing economy of words
    + Should not contain unnecessary words in sentences
    + No unnecessary sentences in paragraphs
* Using simple sentences
    + eg. "Adam wrote code" vs. "adam wrote code for feature he is working on that was requested by user"
    + make the reader work harder
    + complexity may confuse
    
    + Making Sentence optimal with "Knowlege of Audience". eg. "Adam coded for user-requested feature"
    + Make Easy to swallow
    + Break it down into less complexity
    
* Considering delivery strategy
    + Authorship : From whom communication should come , impacts
    + Timing : Contextual time for writing
    + Format : letter, memo , email or verbal
