Some Perspectives from book

* China imports more chips than Oil
* Apple hostorically never made chips, bought off shelf from Japan,California and texas
* Apple designed ultraprocessing chips which can only be manufactured by only one company, most expensive company on earth
  everything in single building, few miles away from USS starboard.
  
* TSMC, Fab 18 fabricates 1 Quantallion (18 zeros)

* Semiconductor is Complex. A typical chip might be 
  + designed with blueprints from the Japanese-owned, UK-based company called Arm, 
  + by a team of engineers in California and Israel, 
  + using design software from the United States. 
  + sent to a facility in Taiwan, which buys ultra-pure silicon wafers and specialized gases from Japan.
  + The design is carved into silicon using some of the world’s most precise machinery,
  + These tools are produced primarily by five companies, one Dutch, one Japanese and three Californian, without which advanced chip basically impossible to make. 
  + Then the chip is packaged and tested, often in Southeast Asia, before being sent to China for assembly into a phone or computer.

## Cold War Chips
* War driven Industrial Attrition, Manufacturing to Military Power with utilization of Copper,Iron, Rubber and Oil
* Story of Bomb sights, Mechanical knobs adjustment to electrical charges
* large Vaccum tube restricted application till code breaking, fueling innovation for "switching" device that is small

### The switch
* Shockley - Semiconductor work solid state value

### Kilby's Integrated Ckt
* Contributed by removing connection wires of vaccume tube/transistors with semiconductor chipped ckts connecting multiple transistors
* Birth of Fairchild Semiconductor

### Liffoff
* Russian advance in space triggered US Nasa

### Mass Production
* Miniaturize Logic : Small Content is zoomed with Lens, Conversly Large Print can be scaled mini 
* Kodacs Photo resist chemical disappear on light,photolithography—printing with light.

### Money flow
* 75% from Defense and Space sector products
* Fairchild first to consumerized and create bussiness apps at low price
* Fairchild owner refused stock options to employees amid "creeping socialism"
* Exit notes from Employee :D 

## The Circuitry of American World
### Soviet Silicon Valley
* USSR Exchange student Trutko studied at US university, lead to investigations of semiconductor quality and quantity, confirm decade later to be KGB agents
* USSR built semiconductor city in 1940s outside moscow as "soviet microelectronics" initiative

### Copy It
* USSR  used "copy it"  strategy to replicate Texas Instruments SN21 

### The Transistor Salesman
* After WW2 , As part of Cold War strategy US built Japan high tech and science power making them "Transistor Salesman"
* Sony came of good in designing consumer products, so US transfered tech of fabrication with intent that japan is still years behind, "complex balancing act between consumers and supply"
* US-Japan semiconductor helped japan increase GDP
### Transistor Girls
* Sporck after joing fairchild offer stock option in exchange of maximizing productivity
* It was era when women assembled semiconductor designed by men in exchange of low wages and less union conflicts
* with increase in work, US labour exhausted, Sporck had to get on to china for 1/10 of wages and twice productivity, no union conflicts
### Precision Strike
* Vietnam war required non-nuclear weapons with guidance system having precision
* Humid climate from southeast asia caused vaccume tube to malfunction since they were hand soldered.
* US installed a simple laser-guidance system to control the wings of missile. 
  + A small silicon wafer was divided into four quadrants and placed behind a lens. 
  + The laser reflecting off the target would shine through the lens onto the silicon. 
  + If the bomb veered off course, one quadrant would receive more of the laser’s energy than the others, and 
  + circuitry would move the wings to reorient the bomb’s trajectory so that the laser was shining straight through the lens.
* A simple laser sensor and a couple of transistors had turned a weapon with a zero-for-638 hit ratio into a tool of precision destruction
* Vietnam was test target for marriage of microelectronics and explosives, Revolution of Warfare

### Supply Chain Statecraft
* For Taiwan, semiconductor supply chains could provide economic growth and bolster political stability.

### Intel’s Revolutionaries
* Founders Leave Fairchild; Form Own Electronics Firm, Noyce,Moore created intel
* Intel launched DRAM in first two years
* coupling a tiny transistor with a capacitor, a miniature storage device that is either charged (1) or not (0). Capacitors leak
over time, so Dennard envisioned repeatedly charging the capacitor via the transistor. The chip would be called a dynamic RAM.
* A generalized Chip was vision over logic ckt, secretly F-16 was using it before intel 4004
* The semiconductor engineers of Silicon Valley had the specialized knowledge, networks, and stock options that let
them write the rules of the future—rules everyone else would have to follow.

### The Pentagon’s Offset Strategy
* Soviet had quantitative advantage,only way to get military advantage is produce better quality weapons
* US envisioned “rapid information gathering,” “sophisticated command and control,” and “terminal guidance” for missiles, imagining munitions
* Plan was to force USSR to work on anti-missle tech, spend billion yet defend few attacks
* Pentagon founded DARPA,to see what would happen if all these new sensors, guided weapons, and communications devices were integrated.
## Leadership Cost
### That Competition Is Tough
* in 1980, HP advanced . US chip fail rate was high than others
* Japan's Sony excelled in building over implementation. To remove second class status, not able to innovate , was  removed by invention and sucess of "Walkman"
* strategy of empowering Japanese businesses seemed to be undermining America’s economic and technological edge
* Japanese worker excelled in productivity due to "amazing pro-company" culture, absent in america

### At War with Japan
* Jerry sanders CEO of AMD in 1969, in legal fight with intel, was marketing guy at fairchild
* economic war with technology, productivity, and quality in america and vs japan
* Hitach,Mitsubishi stole industrial secretes from decoy company FBI made.

### Shipping Junk
* Photolithography -  Silicon indented with light reacting chemicals 
* Lens maker Nikon entered into provision, GCA managed to build first stepper, could not mass produce due to non-engineers

### The Crude Oil of the 1980s (Semiconductor , AMD CEO jerry sanders)
* In 1980, Daily ops involved chip based devices, so Japan was saudi arabia of semiconductor
* Oil in Gulf region was strategic commodity backed by military 
* Japan's capture of 70% on lithography machinery was "national security issue" at US, US companies gang up 
to revitalize semiconductor in america under US presidents orders, pentagon
* Japan lead Tv, Camera and it was time for semiconductor

### Death Spiral
* Sematech industry needed more collaboration to stay competitive
* Boy noyc founder of fairchild and intel, inventor of IC  head of sematech died in 1990
* GCA shut down , joined many others crushed by japanese companies

### The Japan That Can Say No
*  Japan ahead of US in DRAM and electronics, lead to fear of loosing Asian Geopolitical preeminence, and threat to military power

## America Resurgent
### The Potato Chip King
* Potato sorting and french fry machine maker pioneer use of machines, was investor
* Micron was started to make 64k DRAM, tough competition by Fujitsu
* US moved to SKorea for electronics
* US company CEOs lobbied against japanese competition with politics
* Micron made lean production to reduce cost

### Disrupting Intel
* Grove had management philosophy book Only the Paranoid Survive: “Fear of competition, fear of bankruptcy, fear of being wrong and fear of losing can all be
powerful motivators.”
* Restructuring intel - silicon valley capitalism example 
* Intel lost DRAM market in 1980. Same time They won contract of IBM for personal PC, same device for which Bill gates wrote software
* Compaq cloned IBM personal computer with intel chip and microsoft software , assembled PC

### My Enemy’s Enemy”: The Rise of Korea
* Lee Byung-Chul turned Samsung as semiconductor company  in south korea with help of america 
* US policies help south korean company samsung to benefit, for dampening japan advance

### “This Is the Future”
* Convey and Mead led first computer program for designing chip
* Jacob invented algorithm for complex radio communication, which required computing power
later company was called Quality Communication , QualComm.


### USSR spy operated in US, to steal secret and chips

### Weapons of Mass Destruction” : The Impact of the Offset
* USSR spied US miliray who designed better guidance system, accurate nuclear submarines

### War Hero
*  Baghdab in Iraq was bombed by US, Paveway technology iterated after vietnam
### The Cold War Is Over and You Have Won
 
## Integrated Ckt
* Taiwan intentionally became part of SCM with ally US , 1990  TSMC flourish under Morris Chang
* China's political agenda held back semiconductor for year, later in 1970's post-mao, rebounded
## Offshoring innovation

## China's Challenge

## chip Choke
*  China captured market in solar panels leaving US behind
*  China subsidesed seminconductor 
*  Usage of advance chips in weapon is growing concern
*  Export Control from US Commerce destroyed Advanced DRAm Company in China
*  US blocked access to US and US ally equiments to stop china
*  China's Taiwan claim will force US and Allies to enter into conflict over semiconductor
